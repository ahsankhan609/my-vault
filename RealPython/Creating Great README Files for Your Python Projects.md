[[How to write a great README for your GitHub project]]

Most software projects benefit from having a piece of documentation that provides a quick start guide for setting up, using, and contributing to the project. This is especially true in open-source projects where you typically want to attract users and contributors. This type of document is commonly known as a **`README`** file, and you should add one to each Python project you create.

**In this tutorial, you’ll learn:**

- What a **`README`** file is
- How to **organize** a `README` file
- What **document format** to use for `README` files
- How to prepare a `README` file for platforms like **PyPI** and **GitHub**
- What **tools** and **templates** to use to create `README` files

You won’t need special knowledge to read through this tutorial. However, to start creating your own `README` files, you should familiarize yourself with markup languages, such as [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and [reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html).

[Creating Great README Files for Your Python Projects](https://realpython.com/quizzes/readme-python-project/)

Take this quiz to test your understanding of how a great README file can make your Python project stand out and how to create your own README files.

## What Is a README File?

A [`README`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README) file is a document that you typically add to the root directory of a software project. It’s often a short guide that provides essential information about the project. The `README` file aims to help users and developers understand the project’s purpose, how to use it, and how to contribute to it. It’s also a way to communicate with potential users, collaborators, and contributors.

`README` files are typically plain text files that are the most visible piece of documentation and often the landing page for many software projects, including [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) projects.

In most cases, the file name is written in uppercase letters to draw the user’s attention and ensure it’s the first thing they read.

A `README` should contain only the necessary information for users, collaborators, and developers to get started using and contributing to your project. For more extended documentation, [wikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) or dedicated [documentation pages](https://realpython.com/python-project-documentation-with-mkdocs/) are more appropriate and recommended.

## Why Do You Need a README in Your Python Projects?

`README` files have a long history in [free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) and [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) software. The [GNU Coding Standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Coding_Standards) encourage you to include a `README` to provide a *general overview* of the package’s contents. However, this type of file isn’t limited to free and open-source projects. You can add a `README` to any project you like.

Why should you spend time writing a `README` file for your Python projects? Here are a few general reasons:

- `README` files are kind of a **standard** in the software industry.
- The `README` file is frequently the first thing your users will **notice or search for** when they find your project.
- A good `README` file helps your project **stand out** from other projects.
- A high-quality `README` file differentiates a **good project** from a bad one.
- `README` files are often displayed as the **project’s landing page** on software development platforms like [GitHub](https://realpython.com/python-git-github-intro/) and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/).

From a more specialized point of view, a good `README` file can help you:

- **Introduce the project** by providing an overview of what the project is about, its purpose, and its main features.
- **Provide guidance** by offering instructions on how to set up the project for use and contributions.
- **Attract contributors** by providing clear guidelines on how to contribute to the project.
- **Provide documentation** by working as the primary source of documentation for the project.
- **Supply support and contact Information** by providing details on how to get help or contact the project maintainers.
- **Include license information** by specifying the terms for using and contributing to the project.

These are just a few of the benefits of adding a `README` file to your Python projects. So, what do you think? Is it worth it to add them?

## What Is the Usual Structure of a Great README File?

First, you should know that there isn’t *one right way* to structure a high-quality `README` file. In practice, the content and sections you include in this file will depend on your specific project. However, you’ll find that most `README` files have common sections, such as the project’s name, the instructions on how to set up and use the project, guidelines for contributing to the project, and similar topics.

In the following sections, you’ll learn about the most commonly used sections in `README` files and their content.

### Common Sections in Great README Files

Before discussing how to organize a `README` file in a well-structured document with pertinent sections, you’ll briefly consider the general content that most `README` files contain. To approach this topic for a given Python project, you try to answer the following questions:

- What was your **motivation** to build the project?
- What **problem** does the project solve?
- What **technologies** does the project use and why?
- What are the project’s most relevant **features**?
- How can users **get started** with the project?
- Where can users get **help** with your project?

Once you’ve considered these questions, you’ll have enough background information to start writing your project’s `README`. First, you should have a reasonable, readable, and engaging name for your project. This is often a surprisingly challenging step!

Once you have a name, you can start thinking of what content to include in the project’s `README`. Here’s a quick and non-exhaustive list of common topics. Note that some of these sections are only relevant to open-source projects:

- **Project description**: A short description of what your project does. A good way to do this right is to provide:
	- A concise paragraph describing your project
		- A representative screenshot or an animated GIF showing your project in action
- **Installation**: A series of steps that describe how to install the project. If your project is cross-platform, then make sure you list the steps for all the supported platforms.
- **Execution and usage**: The instructions for executing the project if it’s an executable Python application. If the project is a Python library, then you can provide some code examples of using the library. Ideally, you should provide examples that showcase the project’s most relevant features.
- **Used technologies**: A list of used technologies, including third-party Python libraries and frameworks. You can provide a short description of each technology and, optionally, the reasons behind using it.
- **Current features**: A list of current features. You can take advantage of this section to do some marketing around your project by highlighting its most relevant features.
- **Contributing**: A series of steps for contributing to the project. Alternatively, you can create a dedicated contributor’s guide in a separate file, which is common practice in large projects.
- **Contributors**: The list of people who have somehow contributed to your Python project. Crediting contributors is an excellent way to make open-source contributors feel like they’re part of a team effort.
- **Author’s info**: The author’s name and contact information, such as social media accounts and email. This information will be handy for people who want to collaborate with you.
- **Change log**: A condensed change log listing the changes made to the project compared to the previous version.
- **License**: A quick statement about the [license](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository) the software is under. You can include a `LICENSE.txt` file under your project’s root folder and then link to that file. For an open-source Python project, you could go to [opensource.org](https://opensource.org/licenses) and get the license that meets your needs.

Again, this list of sections isn’t exhaustive. It only identifies the most commonly used sections in a typical `README` file.

For `README` files that are on the long side, you should include a table of contents at the beginning of the file to facilitate navigation through the file’s content.

### Useful Badges for README Files

If you use a platform like GitHub to host your project’s source code, then you can include some cool **badges** in your `README` file. Badges are little pictures that you can use in GitHub or GitLab `README` files. For example, you can add some of the following badges to provide additional information about your project in a visual fashion:

- Code coverage:
- Stable version:
- Python:
- SQLite:
- License:

You can add these and several other badges to your project’s `README` as a way to visually showcase essential details about the project.

You can use badges from several online services. Some of these services include:

- [Shields.io](https://shields.io/)
- [Badgen](https://badgen.net/)

For a list of badges to use in your project’s `README`, take a look at the [Awesome Badges](https://github.com/badges/awesome-badges) repository on GitHub.

Finally, if you use GitLab to host your project’s source code, you should check out their [badge-related page](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/badges.html) in their official documentation. On this page, you’ll find detailed instructions on how to set up badges for a given project.

## Which Document Format Can You Use for a README?

To write a `README` file for a Python project, you’ll use a plain text file. You can structure the file’s content using different markup languages. The two most commonly used languages are the following:

- **[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)**: A lightweight markup language that allows you to style a plain text file using formatting techniques like headings, emphasis, lists, images, and links. It’s one of the most popular markup languages nowadays.
- **[reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html)**: An easy-to-read, what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) plain text markup language that uses intuitive constructs to indicate a document’s structure. It allows you to define constructs, such as section headings, bullet lists, and emphasis.

Here’s a quick comparison of both languages:

| Feature | Markdown | reStructuredText |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Syntax | Simple and minimal | More elaborate and comprehensive |
| File extension | `.md` | `.rst` |
| Headers | `#`, `##`, `###`, … | `====`, `----`, `~~~~`, … |
| Lists | Ordered and unordered | Ordered and unordered |
| Links | `[text](url)` | `text <url>` |
| Images | `![alt text](url)` | `.. image:: url` |
| Emphasis | `**bold**`, `*italic*` | `**bold**`, `*italic*` |
| Code blocks | Indented with 4 spaces or backticks | Indented with 4 spaces, `::` |
| Tables | Basic table support | More advanced table support |
| Footnotes | Limited support | More complete support |
| Table of contents generation | Limited | Built-in support |
| Extensions and plugins | Various extensions available | Rich built-in directives and roles |
| Use cases | Blog posts, documentation, notes | Comprehensive documentation, books |
| Rendering | Widely supported | Supported through specific tools |
| Learning curve | Low | Medium to high |

Both languages have their pros and cons. Markdown is often preferred for `README` files because, in most cases, this type of file doesn’t require complex formatting. In contrast, if your `README` file requires advanced formatting features, then reStructuredText can be a better option.

Popular online software development platforms, such as [GitHub](https://realpython.com/python-git-github-intro/) and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/company/), provide support for both markup languages. When it comes to Markdown, both platforms have their own flavors. If your project’s source code is hosted in one of these platforms, then you should check out the corresponding flavored Markdown specification.

## How Can You Prepare Your README for PyPI or GitHub?

When you publish your projects to the Python Package Index ([PyPI](https://realpython.com/pypi-publish-python-package/)) or host the project’s source code in a platform like GitHub, you may need to follow some requirements or guidelines to build your `README` files.

In the following sections, you’ll learn about these requirements and guidelines, focusing on PyPI and GitHub.

### README Files for PyPI

Having a great `README` file for your Python project hosted in PyPI can help it stand out from similar projects on the platform. A well-crafted `README` creates a good first impression about the [quality](https://realpython.com/python-package-quality/) of your project.

For your `README` to display nicely on PyPI, you can use either Markdown or reStructuredText markup language. You can also use plain text, but by doing so, you’ll have limited formatting options.

If you choose Markdown language, then you should use the [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/). On the other hand, if you go with reStructuredText, then you can use the standard syntax without [Sphinx](https://realpython.com/courses/python-sphinx/) extensions.

Finally, it’s customary to save your `README` file in the project’s root folder. This way, PyPI will automatically detect the `README` and display it as the project’s landing page.

### README Files for GitHub

When you host your project’s code on GitHub as an open-source project, then you should use the [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) and save the `README` file in your project’s root folder or the repository’s `.github/` or `docs/` directories.

If you place the `README` in one of these folders, GitHub will recognize it and automatically surface the file to visitors who find your repository.

To dive deeper into GitHub’s features related to `README` files, check out the [About READMEs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) page. Among other topics, you’ll find the following:

- [Auto-generated table of contents for `README` files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes#auto-generated-table-of-contents-for-readme-files)
- [Section links in `README` files and blob pages](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes#section-links-in-readme-files-and-blob-pages)
- [Relative links and image paths in `README` files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes#relative-links-and-image-paths-in-readme-files)

With these guidelines, you’ll be able to quickly create a `README` file for a new project or customize an existing `README`.
